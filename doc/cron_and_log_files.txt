Running cron jobs such as fae_nightly_maintenance requires the following in Ubuntu:

1. Put this at the top of the crontab file: SHELL=/bin/bash. This causes
   cron to run under the bash shell instead of the default sh shell, and
   consequently causes bash scripts to work as expected.

2. Re. FAE timing.log: This file is written to by www-data as FAE evaluates
   sites in its the normal operating mode. When the fae_nightly_maintenance
   script is run as a cron job owned by www-data, even though the scripts
   that this job calls write to a different log file, the timing.log file
   is opened because init_logger() gets called. If www-data does not have
   write permissions for that file, the job will fail.

3. Re. FAE maintenance.log: This file is written to by www-data as well,
   so it makes sense that it should be the owner. However, this means
   collect_stats and purge_reports cannot be run under my login unless
   the file has group write permissions set.
