1. To delete inactive accounts (where users registered but did not
   confirm their registration AND are inactive) use this command:

   $ python manage.py cleanupregistration

2. To cleanup expired sessions in the session table:

   $ django-admin.py cleanup

3. The following lines should be added to crontab (with modifications
   depending on installation) for automating the collection of usage
   statistics and purging of reports:

   PYTHONPATH=/services/faedata/lib
   DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=project.settings
   10 3 * * * /usr/bin/python $PYTHONPATH/project/fae/scripts/collect_stats.py
   20 3 * * * /usr/bin/python $PYTHONPATH/project/fae/scripts/purge_reports.py

4. When the Fedora OS is upgraded, the following steps are needed:

   * In /services/fae[dev|test]/html/media delete the symbolic link named admin
     and update its definition to point at the new Django admin/media directory:

     ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media admin

   * Rebuild wget (see doc/installation.txt) and copy the new executable to the
     /services/fae[dev|test]/bin directory.

   * Likewise with wamt (the ocaml executable).

   * Restart apache.
