1. To delete inactive accounts (where users registered but did not
   confirm their registration AND are inactive) use this command:

   $ python manage.py cleanupregistration # NOTE: This is no longer supported!

2. To cleanup expired sessions in the session table:

   $ django-admin.py cleanup

3. The following lines should be added to crontab (with modifications
   depending on installation) for automating the collection of usage
   statistics and purging of reports:

   SHELL=/bin/bash
   MAILTO="nhoyt"
   10 3 * * * /services/fae[dev|test|data]/lib/project/fae/scripts/fae_nightly_maintenance

   crontab commands:
   $ sudo crontab -u www-data -l  # list
   $ sudo crontab -u www-data -e  # edit

   ubuntu mail command:
   $ mutt

4. When the OS is upgraded, the following steps are needed:

   * In /services/fae[dev|test]/html/media delete the symbolic link named admin
     and update its definition to point at the new Django admin/media directory:

   $ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media admin (Fedora)
   $ ln -s /usr/share/pyshared/django/contrib/admin/media admin (Ubuntu)

   * Rebuild wget (see doc/installation.txt) and copy the new executable to the
     /services/fae[dev|test|data]/bin directory.

   * Likewise with wamt (the ocaml executable).

   * Make sure that /services/fae[dev|test|data]/html/logs/timing.log exists and
     is owned by the apache user account.

   * Restart apache.

5. Installing a new version of FAE 1.x

   * stop Apache

   * delete /services/faexxx/lib/project directory and its contents

   * use getproject alias to export current fae-django revision

   * use getwamt alias to copy the current faetest version of wamt

   * create subdirectory logs/dhtmlget with proper permissions

   * run the script: project/fae/scripts/copy_files

   * start Apache
