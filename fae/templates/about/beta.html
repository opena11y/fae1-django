<li>Account management: registration, login, and entering profile information under 'My Account'</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing Guidelines</h2>

<p>During the beta testing phase, it's important to note the following:</p>

<p>As new beta versions of FAE are made available leading up to the release of 1.0, rules will change &mdash; new rules will be added, and existing rules may be modified. To avoid resulting incompatibilities, the reports database will be purged when new beta versions are released. This will include deletion of reports that are marked for permanent archiving.</p>

<h2>Discussion Group</h2>
<p>A discussion group has been created in Google Groups for those who would like to actively participate in beta testing. The group is called <a class="external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/faebeta">FAE 1.0 Beta Test</a>.</p>
